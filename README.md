Monitoring vaccine efficacy using AI &amp; ML.
Here, we have proposed a new method of estimating the vaccine efficacy using AI and ML.
First, we have created a web app by which we can upload the images of the filled forms.
Those images are then taken as Test images and by using the pytessearct, the contents of the forms are evaluated and uploaded to a csv file.
Then, that csv file is used to calculate the vaccine efficacy.
The efficacy is then shown by data visualisation.
