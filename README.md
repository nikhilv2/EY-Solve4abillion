Monitoring vaccine efficacy using AI &amp; ML.
Here, we have proposed a new method of estimating the vaccine efficacy using AI and ML.
First, we created a web app through which the images of the filled query forms can be uploaded.
These images are taken as "Test Images" and by employing Python-tessearct, the contents of the forms are evaluated and uploaded to a csv file.
From the csv file, the vaccine efficacy is calculated using LightGBM.
The vaccine efficacy is also illustrated by Data Visualisation implementing Matplotlib and Pandas.
